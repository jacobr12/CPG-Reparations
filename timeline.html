            <div class="timeline-event" data-title="Opening of Ravenswood High School" data-content="Belinda Royall, formerly enslaved in the Royall House, initiated one of the first cases seeking reparations for slavery in the United States. In 1783, she petitioned the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a pension from the estate of her deceased owner, Isaac Royall. Her petition detailed her childhood in Africa, the horrors of her capture, and the brutal journey across the Atlantic that brought her into slavery. The Massachusetts legislature granted her request, recognizing her suffering and advanced age, but framed her as a figure of pity rather than a representative of a broader cause for liberty and justice. The details about the consistency of the pension payments remain unclear, and while her petition called for reparations, the legislative response did not fully acknowledge the broader implications for liberty and reparations for slavery">

            <div class="timeline-event" data-title="Proposition 13 Passed" data-content="Proposition 13 was passed by California voters, amending the state constitution to cap property taxes at 1% of assessed value at the time of the last sale and limiting annual assessment increases to no more than 2% unless the property is sold or newly constructed. This meant that properties held over long periods faced much lower taxes compared to newly purchased or constructed properties. This created disparities among property owners, potentially influencing the real estate market and community demographics over time.

            <div class="timeline-event" data-title="Demolition of Whiskey Gulch" data-content="On July 20, 1998, an official proposal was pitched to demolish Whiskey Gulch, including its small-owned liquor store, personal care stores, realty offices and jewelry shops, in order to develop the area into a more corporate focused space. The plan included the development of a five-star hotel and commercial office space in order to bring financial revenue into the area. This plan was backed by political rhetoric that EPA was “lawless,” “blighted” and antiquated, and should be redeveloped and brought into the modern world. The project was ultimately carried through, and although it brought substantial financial benefits to EPA, the cultural losses are harder to quantify. East Palo Altans lost an important community symbol and gathering space.
