            data-content="Belinda Royall, formerly enslaved in the Royall House, initiated one of the first cases seeking reparations for slavery in the United States. In 1783, she petitioned the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a pension from the estate of her deceased owner, Isaac Royall. Her petition detailed her childhood in Africa, the horrors of her capture, and the brutal journey across the Atlantic that brought her into slavery. The Massachusetts legislature granted her request, recognizing her suffering and advanced age, but framed her as a figure of pity rather than a representative of a broader cause for liberty and justice. The details about the consistency of the pension payments remain unclear, and while her petition called for reparations, the legislative response did not fully acknowledge the broader implications for liberty and reparations for slavery"

The practice of redlining was outlawed with the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, but the legacy of the practice is evident in under-resourced communities which are predominantly black and brown."

Over the next few decades, particularly in the 60s and the 70s, the annexation of Belle Haven to Menlo Park, as well as other surrounding areas, created difficulties for East Palo Alto as it affected their ability to gain revenue from property taxes, especially as they began considering incorporation and how to support the city thereafter."

These communities began to be apprehensive of the predominantly Black population of East Palo Alto, which worsened unemployment and economic issues in the community."

The plan included the development of a five-star hotel and commercial office space in order to bring financial revenue into the area. This plan was backed by political rhetoric that EPA was “lawless,” “blighted” and antiquated, and should be redeveloped and brought into the modern world. The project was ultimately carried through, and although it brought substantial financial benefits to the EPA, the cultural losses are harder to quantify. East Palo Alto lost an important community symbol and gathering space. "

The council unanimously approved the redevelopment, highlighting broader tensions between the low-income, majority-minority East Palo Alto and wealthier, majority-white Silicon Valley suburbs. The decision reflected shifts in urban renewal narratives and the use of legal instruments for redevelopment."
